                    Hello!! My name is Savankumar Patel. I was born in India. At the age of 13, my family moved to United States of America.
                     It was new world for me, everything was different. New language, new culture, new people, and new education system.
                      While back in India I studied little english, but wasn't enough to help me function in school.
                      It wasn't too long after I started catching up and moving ahead of struggles. 
                      By the time I finished my high school, I was introduced to another world... The working world. 
                      My family didn't have enough money to put me through college so I decided to join my family business and worked another part time job to pay my bills. 
                      It wasn't another 10 years until I was able to put my self back in education. It was then where I realized I wanted to pursue an education in web development.
                      I learned so much and started learning new techniques and tricks. Please feel free to checkout some of my work I created while learning in class.
