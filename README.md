# Infomation
 
In this web page you will find I applied HTML/CSS 
 
# List of properties applied
-   Html5 
-   Css style sheet
-   Header > in header I included nav , ul , li and a tags.
-   After creating the header I created the footer for the page which is the most important part.
    
    In the footer I included div and a-tag. a-tag has info about who created this file and copyright infomation
-    Next, I created the body section which I named **myinfo** in this section I included my profile picture and a subtag for the page with H2 tag
-   Next, I moved on to the flex box . Using the flex property I aligned all columns giving them 2 rows.
In the first row, the heading of infomation which I gave is matching with header in the navigation menu. I included my info, my work, find me, and contact me.
-   Next, I included my infomation, and wrote my history to give some basic information to my future employer about myself.
-    I then moved on to the next part which was made using display grid property.
In this part I made grids and in the grids I included background picture of the projects I created.
- While this seems easy it was really hard to arrange. by using grid-template-area I asssigned area to divs and asked them to span first child to 3. 
-   Next, I moved on to social media div, in this I agained used grid . and as background imege I taged social media infomation .
-   Next, I included contact infomation in contact div. and linked them with my phone, email, and a few other social media pages.
-   I moved on to @media  query which helps users view my web page in different screens. 
-   Lastly, I moved on to the header and contact tags so I can give them the hover effect. When users hover over the link, it will have the visual effect.
