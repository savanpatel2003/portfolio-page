#   infomation

creating web is lots of work and takes so much infomation and knowledge 
in this web page you will find we tried to apply HTML/CSS 
 
# list of rules we apply
-   html5 
-   css style sheet
-   header > in header we included nav , ul , li and a tags.
-   after creating header we created footer for page which is most important part.
    in footer we included div and a tag . a tag had info about who created this file and copy right infomation
-    next we created body section which we gave name **myinfo** in this section we included my profile pic and subtag for page with H2 tag
-   next we moved on to flex box . using flex property we alined all columns giving them 2 rows.
in first row we gave heading of infomation which we gave id matching with header navigation menu.
whih included my info, my work, find me, and contact me.
-   next we included my infomation, and wrote my history to give some basic information to my future employe about my self.
-    next we moved on to next part which was made using display grid property.
in this part we made grids and in them grids we included background pic of my projects we created.
- while this seems easy it was really hard to arrange.by using grid-template-area we asssigned area to divs and asked them to span first child to 3. 
-   next we moved on to social media div, in this we agained used grid . and as background imege we taged social media infomation .
-   next we included contact infomation in contact div. and linked them with my phone, email, and few other social page.
-   next we moved on to @media  quory which helps user view my web page in diffent screen. 
-   next we moved on to header and contact tags so we can give them hoover effect. so when user click their mouse it will have visual effect.
